Goals:

1. Use HTML5, CSS, TypeScript, JavaScript as you see fit.
2. Handle the data received from the api
3. Use components, class and services
4. Create Student List
5. It must contain the INCLUDE, ALTER AND EXCLUDE operations
6. It should contain a search field in the list of students
7. Friendly and intuitive layout
8. Use Angular Material
9. A good code structure is indentation 
    - I used prettier + eslint for this
